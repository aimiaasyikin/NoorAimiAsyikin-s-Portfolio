Hi, I'm Noor Aimi Asyikin.

I have over three years of experience in data classification, quality control, and analytics, primarily in digital media and audience measurement. I am always eager to learn and improve, with skills in Python, BI reporting, and process automation. My background in mathematics has helped me develop a strong analytical mindset, and I am passionate about ensuring data accuracy and streamlining workflows.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems. I am confident in working with large datasets, extracting meaningful insights, and communicating my findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences using dashboards.

I am recognized for my charming and pleasant demeanor, enabling me to motivate and uplift others effectively. Valued for my attentive listening and openness to new ideas, I am a collaborative team member and coworker.
